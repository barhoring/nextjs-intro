# Routing Basics in Next.js

This README provides an overview of routing fundamentals in Next.js, including file-based routing, route groups, and advanced navigation features introduced in Next.js 13.

## Directory Structure

- Organize routes using folders in the `/app` directory, where each folder corresponds to a URL segment.

## Key Features

- **Route Groups**: Create invisible folder structures (e.g., `(admin)`).
- **Special Files**: Use `layout.js`, `loading.js`, and `error.js` to manage layouts, loading states, and errors.
- **Advanced Routing**: Parallel and intercepting routes for complex navigation.
